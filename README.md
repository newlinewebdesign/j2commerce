## About

J2Commerce is the next generation of J2Store, rebuilt from the ground up for Joomla 6. It replaces the legacy FOF 2 framework with native Joomla MVC, swaps jQuery for vanilla ES6+ JavaScript, and ships as a single installable package with 33+ bundled extensions.

If you've used J2Store, J2Commerce is the upgrade path. If you're new, it's a complete ecommerce solution that runs inside Joomla — no external platform, no SaaS dependency.

## Migrating from J2Store

J2Commerce includes a migration tool (`plg_system_j2commerce_migration_tool`) that handles the transition from J2Store v4. Original `#__j2store_*` tables are preserved untouched — J2Commerce uses its own `#__j2commerce_*` tables, so you can roll back if needed.

---

## Architecture

J2Commerce is built on native Joomla 6 patterns:

- **Namespaced PHP 8.3+** — PSR-12, strict types, constructor promotion, match expressions
- **Native MVC** — Joomla's `AdminController`, `ListModel`, `FormModel`, `HtmlView`, `Table`
- **Dependency injection** — service providers, MVC factory
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — ES6+ with fetch/async-await, event delegation, no jQuery
- **Web Asset Manager** — all CSS/JS registered through Joomla's asset pipeline
- **Event-driven plugins** — `SubscriberInterface` with named events, no legacy triggers
